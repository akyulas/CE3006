# CE3006

The following section describes the required steps needed to replicate the plots that were achieved in each 
section. All the required files will be found enclosed in the zip file submitted in NTULearn. As the data 
generation and noise generation is random, the plots may not appear to be the exact same but will follow a 
similar trend.

Phase 1 : Data generation
“LabProject3006.m" is used for Phase 1 : Data Generation of the project.

Phase 2 : Modulation for communication
Run the “LabProject3006Part2.m” file for the plot of Bit Error Performance vs SNR values.
Run the “LabProject3006Part2ExtraPlots.m” for the plot of OOK signals at different stages at 5db
Run the “LabProject3006Part2ExtraPlotsBPSK.m” for the plot of BPSK signals at different stages at 5db

Phase 3
Run the “HammingEncodedOOKvsNonEncodedOOK.m” file for the plot of Bit Error Rate Performance vs SNR values
for Hamming Encoded OOK vs Non Encoded OOK Signals.

Run the “HammingEncodedBPSKvsNonEncodedBPSK.m” file for the plot of Bit Error Rate Performance vs SNR values
for Hamming Encoded BPSK vs Non Encoded BPSK Signals.

Run the “LinearEncodedOOKvsNonEncodedOOK.m” file for the plot of Bit Error Rate Performance vs SNR values
for Linear Encoded OOK vs Non Encoded OOK Signals.

Run the “LinearEncodedBPSKvsNonEncodedBPSK.m” file for the plot of Bit Error Rate Performance vs SNR values
for Linear Encoded BPSK vs Non Encoded BPSK.

Run the “CyclicEncodedOOKvsNonEncodedOOK.m” file for the plot of Bit Error Rate Performance vs SNR values
for Cyclic Encoded OOK vs Non Encoded OOK. 

Run the “CyclicEncodedBPSKvsNonEncodedBPSK.m” file for the plot of Bit Error Rate Performance vs SNR values
for Cyclic Encoded BPSK vs Non Encoded BPSK.

Run the “OOKLinearvsHammingvsCyclic.m” file for the plot of Bit Error Rate Performance vs SNR values
for Linear Encoded OOK vs Hamming Encoded OOK vs Cyclic Encoded OOK.
